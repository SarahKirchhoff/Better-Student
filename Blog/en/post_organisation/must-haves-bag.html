        <h2 class="sub_headline">9 Items that should be in every student's bag</h2>
        <p class="absatz">
            It doesn't matter if you study art, physics or law, there should be certain must-have items in your bag for your
            day-to-day life as a student.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Laptop</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Definitely, must-have number one. Especially in times of digital teaching, where more and more 
            lecture scripts and literature are provided online. If you are carrying your laptop with you all 
            the time, you are prepared for every situation and have access to all your documents. <br><br>

            You donâ€™t have a Laptop yet? Well, you really should think about buying one. It doesnâ€™t 
            have to be the most expensive and powerful one. A cheaper model will work too. Maybe you 
            even have the change to get a used one for the beginning. <br><br>

            You are having a nice Computer at home and you donâ€™t want to have an extra Laptop? Now it 
            really depends on your studies. You will realize real soon, when a Laptop would benefit 
            you. And especially in this case, a smaller and cheaper model is absolutely sufficient. 
        </p>
        <h3>2. Chargers</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Of course, you need to charge your Laptop. Without battery your Laptop is just extra 
            weight on your shoulders. <br><br>
            When and where is my next class taking place? Probably youâ€™ll find the answer in your phone. 
            So, in order to never be too late to class, make sure you bring your charger for your phone as well. 
            Actually, I recommend you to buy a second charger, so you can leave one in your dorm and the other one 
            can stay in your bag all the time. 
        </p>
        <h3>3. Headphones</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            You like to study in the library or in the little coffee shop around the corner? You definitely need good 
            headphones then. My personal favorites are those in-ear headphones because they are smaller and have less weight. 
        </p>
        <h3>4. Paper and pens</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Logical. If you want to take notes during your classes you need some paper and pens. I recommend you to look 
            for good quality notebooks because only on high quality paper your texts and pictures will come into full effect. <br>
            Keep your eyes open for paper shops at or close to your university. They sometimes have great offers, where you can 
            find best quality office supplies to student friendly prices. 
            <br><br>
            You are the proud owner of a tablet? Wonderful! I still recommend you to always carry a notebook and at least one 
            pen with you. Sometimes, when you are in a hurry, itâ€™s faster this way.      
        </p>
        <h3>5. Reusable water bottle </h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            When you have to spend the entire day in university again, itâ€™s important to drink enough â€“ but you know this already. Having a nice 
            reusable water bottle will help you with this and additionally you do something good for the environment. 
        </p>
        <h3>6. Healthy snacks</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            We all know that a long day in college can be very exhausting. Besides a sufficient water intake, healthy meals and 
            snacks can be a quick and powerful booster for more energy and a better focus. <br>
            Muesli bars, nuts, and any fruits are a perfect between-meal snack. Just be careful that delicate fruits 
            (like bananas) are not landing under your heavy textbooks ðŸ˜‰
        </p>
        <h3>7. Tissue paper</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            It seems to be no important, but when you think back you probably found yourself in a situation where you whished 
            to have a tissue paper. <br>
            Besides blowing your nose, those little hankies can also be used to clean a dirty table or to get rid of a gum. 
        </p>
        <h3>8. Gum</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            A gum can be a real lifesaver. Because who likes to walk around the campus with a bad breath after lunch?        
        </p>
        <h3>9. Emergency set</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            A little bag with patches, pain killers, and some medicine for stomach aches should find a place in your 
            college bag. For the ladies: a nail file, lip balm, and one or two emergency tampons should be added.
