        <h2 class="sub_headline">These tips will help you to increase your productivity and to reduce stress</h2>
        <p class="absatz">
            Yes, we students do not have it easy in life. Besides the already challenging studies, we often have to keep our heads above water with a part-time job and of course we don't want to neglect our hobbies, friends and family. <br>
            I myself study physics in Germany, have a mini-job, and do sports every day. With the following tips, I still manage to eat three healthy meals a day, sleep 7 hours a night, and am still successful in my studies.
        </p>

        <h3>1. You need a Planner</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            You've probably heard this tip a few times, and there's a good reason for it. Creating a plan for the upcoming week will take you no more than 30 minutes and will save you a lot of stress, procrastination and a pile of unfinished tasks at the end of the week. <br>
            I recommend you use a planner that shows each day by the hour. This way you can make sure you plan your day effectively and don't miss anything. Whether you use a digital planner or a paper one depends on your preferences. <br><br>
            Here is an example of how I plan my week: <br>
            On Sundays, I take some time to look at the upcoming week. I start writing down all fixed appointments. This includes lectures, seminars, doctor's appointments, training sessions, etc. If you use a digital planner, there is a very handy repeat function. It is also recommended to choose a fixed color scheme, so that each entry has its own color according to its category (university, work, sports, etc.). When all fixed appointments are listed, I have a good overview of the free time blocks. Here, I schedule times for studying, as well as other leisure activities with friends. By doing this I always follow tip no. 2.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Be honest with yourself</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            In order to be able to execute your plan, it is important to be honest with yourself. By this I mean that you should be aware of how much time you need for each task. If it happens regularly that you plan 30 minutes for a task, but end up spending two hours on it, then you'll be behind schedule faster than you can think. This leads to a guilty conscience, stress and self-doubt. Sure, this can happen to anyone from time to time. But if you find yourself in this situation regularly, you should learn to be honest with yourself and schedule more time for individual tasks.<br>
            You tried to plan your day but you feel that this meticulous planning doesn't work for you? Maybe this is exactly your problem. If you create an absolutely unrealistic plan, you quickly feel frustrated and not good enough.   <br><br>
            Note: Don't forget to allow enough time for breaks and short interruptions!
        </p>
        <h3>3. Work smarter not harder</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            We have all heard this phrase before. But what does it actually mean? <br><br>
            Here's a quick example from my undergraduate days: <br>
            I crammed together with my fellow students for several hours a day. Afterwards, I went over our joint notes again at home. The exam at the end of the semester taught me an important lesson. All the fellow students from my study group got a good grade, except for me, who failed. So why was that? I had studied just as much (if not more) than the others, hadn't I? <br>
            The answer is quite simple. I didn't know what type of learner I was at the time. Everyone has their own preferences and everyone learns differently. I made the mistake of learning exactly like the others. However, I was not aware that I am a very visual learner. <br><br>
            So find out for yourself which learning type you are. Visual, auditory, sensory or communicative? You should also know the hours at which you are most productive. Are you an early bird or more the night owl? Once you understand yourself better, you can use this knowledge to your advantage and learn more effectively.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Just do what you can</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Don't take on each and every task, instead learn to say "no". Sometimes it happens that we say yes to something we don't want to do. Especially as a student, we think, "Oh God, I need to make a good impression. I can't say no to this now." And so easily, we have one more annoying task in our planner. Therefore, learn to say no sometimes. You don't owe the other person an excuse or a reason. Just be polite and keep it short.<br><br>
            The same applies to leisure activities. If you are invited to something you don't feel like doing, you can say "no" to it. <br>         
        </p>
        <h3>5. Live a healthy lifestyle</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Everyone reacts differently to stress. But we all have one thing in common: too much stress has negative effects on our body and we find ourselves in a vicious circle from which it is difficult to escape.<br>
            Here are just a few examples: restless sleep, hunger attacks, irritability, blemished skin, ... <br><br>
            With a healthy and balanced lifestyle, we can better control stressful situations and escape the vicious circle. This includes at least seven hours of sleep, three healthy meals and enough time to rest. These habits are easy to implement and will give you more energy during the day, increase your focus and thus increase your effectiveness and productivity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Good time management habits will ease your studies and turn you into a more relaxed, happier, and more productive student. Of course, these habits are not limited to your studies, but can help you in any situation in life.
