        <h2 class="sub_headline">Pay attention to these hints from your professor and your preparation for the next exam will be a breeze!</h2>
        <p class="absatz">
            Does the following scenario sounds familiar to you? You are sitting in a lecture, the professor is talking and talking and you are listening lost in thought. Suddenly you hear pens clicking all around you and your fellow students are frantically taking notes. You ask yourself "What's happening right now?", "Did I miss something?", "I was listening the whole time...".
        </p>
        <p class="absatz">
            So that this doesn't happen to you anymore, I'll give you 11 tips on how to detect the hidden hints and clues from your professor. One note first: Not all professors are the same. But basically everyone tries to give more or less clear hints on exam relevant topics. So listen carefully and start reading between the lines.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. The direct hint</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Some professors make it really easy for you. They get straight to the point and say: "The next chapter will be relevant for the exam" or "What we have just discussed will be important for the exam". Sometimes there are sentences like: "I have asked about this topic in every exam so far" or "This topic is ideal for the exam". 
        </p>
        <h3>2. The professor repeats himself/herself</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            If a lecturer keeps repeating himself/herself and you feel like you are tapped in a time loop, then you should urgently start listening and taking notes. With his/her constant repetitions, he/she wants to make you aware of the importance of the topic. You will also notice that his/her tone of voice changes to emphasize what he/she is repeating. 
        </p>
        <h3>3. Examples</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Theoretical concepts and contents are practically applied in examples. And what do you have to do in the exam at the end? Exactly, you have to understand the content of a topic and be able to apply it practically. With planned, but also with spontaneous examples, your lecturer gives you hidden clues as to which topics are relevant for the exam. 
        </p>
        <h3>4. Call to be attentive</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            "At this point, you need to pay close attention!" This is a classic phrase that many professors use frequently. They are telling you a little more indirectly that something important and mostly basic is about to be discussed. This fundamental content is usually the basic framework for the exam and you should listen carefully.
        </p>   
    
        <h3>5. Call for postprocessing</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Some professors use sentences such as: "I would take another close look at this chapter". Here, too, an indirect hint is hidden that exactly this chapter will be relevant for the exam. In a lecture not all chapters are equal. Some chapters or sections are more important than others and your professor wants to tell you in this way which chapter will have a higher importance for the exam.
        </p>   
        
        <h3>6. Pointing out common mistakes</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            There are some mistakes that are made by almost every student. Often, professors even point them out. Typical examples are: "Many students get this wrong" or "I often get this wrong in the exam". These statements also contain indications that this topic is relevant for the exam.
        </p>   
       
        <h3>7. The choice of words of the professor</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            If your professor often uses the words "interesting" and/or "important" when introducing a new topic, you should listen carefully and take notes. Your professor's choice of words quite indirectly indicates that your professor is personally interested in this topic or that it is fundamental content. Either way, you should mark this topic as relevant to the exam.
        </p>   

        <h3>8. The last lecture</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            In the last lecture before the exam, almost every professor goes through all the chapters again and summarizes each chapter briefly. Pay particular attention to which chapters or sections he/she only deals with very briefly and which are discussed in more detail. This will give you a good indication of what is important for the exam.
        </p>  

        <h3>9. Past exam questions</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Past exams form a solid basis for your exam preparation. However, not every professor makes his/her past exams available to the students. But that's not a problem - you can ask other students from higher semesters or ask around among your fellow students if someone has a past exam. Orientate yourself on the topics that were asked in the this exam and work through the individual tasks conscientiously.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Trust your gut feeling</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Your gut feeling can also be an important indication of topics relevant to the exam. So trust your intuition and make a note if you have the feeling that what you have discussed will be important for the exam.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Swap ideas</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Before you start preparing for the exam, it is often helpful to talk to your fellow students. Compare which topics you consider relevant for the exam and which you can exclude. If your assessments are mostly the same, you can be sure that you can prepare efficiently for the exam.
