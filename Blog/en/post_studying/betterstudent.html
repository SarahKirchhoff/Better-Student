        <h2 class="sub_headline">This is what you have to do to become a straight-A student!</h2>
        <p class="absatz">
            Straight-A student... just by reading this word you probably think about a certain name.
            There is this one student, who is never struggeling and always getting the best grades. 
            In my case his name was Fabian. And to be honest, I was jealous of him all the time. I 
            asked myself, why can I not be like him? I am studying way harder and still, my grades are just
            solid average.
        </p>
        <p class="absatz">
            Let me tell you this: Fabian understood, that it takes more than endless study sessions and 
            hours in the libary to become an outstanding student. More important than this is your attitude.
            With little changes in your lifestyle, organisation, and dedication you can become a straight-A
            student in no time.
        </p>
        <p class="absatz">
            Here are my 8 Tips for becoming a successful student:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Love what you are doing</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            First things first. If you chose a course you are not really interesed in, it is hard to achive
            good results. Sure, here and there we have to deal with some mandatory topics, that we are not interested
            in. Exactly in those moments it is important to know your "why?". If you know your "why?", even those
            topics can not hold you back.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Take care of your health</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Your body and brain are working close together. If your body is tired and drained, your brain will 
            automatically work slower and it's harder for you to stay focused. So, eat healthy, drink enough water,
            stay active, and get your sleep. You want to go one step further? Try meditation and breathing exercises
            to relax.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Be organised</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Being organised is the most important habit of every successful person. And I am not only talking about
            your study notes. I am talking about your entire day. Take 15 minutes every evening to plan the upcoming
            day. Like this, you are able to focus on what matters and you don't think about 1000 other task while you
            are studying.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Prioritize</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            I am pretty sure you already know this one, but it's hard to implement it. What is it exaclty that
            is holding you back from prioritizing your studies? Is it the fear of missing out? Or do you try to
            avoid studying by binge watching Netflix? Whatever it is: resist! Of course, you have to find the right balance. Don't 
            isolate youself and study 24/7.
        </p>   
    
        <h3>5. Be in time, never leave early, and don't skip classes</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            You are already stressed in the morning because you are late? Not a good prerequisite...
            If you are already stressed before your fist class even starts, it's harder for you to
            concentrate and to follow your lecturer. Try to be there at least 5 minutes earlier. This way you have
            enough time to prepare mentally and to organise your notes. Of course, never leaving early and never skipping classes will
            also help you to fully understand every part of what is thaught.
        </p>   
        
        <h3>6. Sit in the front</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Yes, I am serious. Chose a seat in the front of the lecture hall. By doing so, you are reducing
            possible distractions. You will not notice the flirting couple in the row in front of you 
            andymore or that one girl alway checking out the newest beauty trends. Besides that, you don't struggle 
            to read someting on the board/beamer and it's easier to take your notes. <br>

            You don't dare to sit in the front? No problem. I felt the same in the beginning. Just sit down as far to
            the front as you feel comfortable. But try to advance from time to time. It doesn't have to be the 
            first row right away ;)
        </p>   
       
        <h3>7. Be active</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Now that you are already sitting closer to the front, make it a habit to listen carefully and to communicate through
            your body language with you lecturer. Believe me, he/she will be grateful for that. You don't understand something?
            Go ahead and ask! Just by asking right away you are able to follow the class. <br>

            You are scared what others may think of you? Don't be! I myself used to be impressed when someone asked a question.
            No matter if I knew the answer or not. He or she had my respect, because he/she was brave enough to ask. 
        </p>   
       
        <h3>8. Do your assignments and homeworks</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Depending on what you study you may have to hand in assignments or weekly homeworks. You always have to be able to 
            safely say you did your best. Know your deadlines, start early enough and aks for help if you are stuck.
