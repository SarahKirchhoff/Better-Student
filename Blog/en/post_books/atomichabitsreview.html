            According to James Clear, habits are the smallest building blocks of our lives that we perform automatically without thinking. 
            They subconsciously navigate us through our daily lives and our actions are built on them.

                    True change comes through the accumulation of hundreds of small decisions and habits that accumulate over time to produce remarkable results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each habit can be divided into four stages of a habit loop: <br> Cue - Craving - Response - Reward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are four laws of behavior change to form new habits: make the action visible, make the action attractive, make the action easy for you, and make the action satisfying.

            </h2>
            <p>
                I now realize much more what I do every day. Because every little action - good & bad - becomes a habit over time. This book has opened my eyes and helped me develop new habits and break bad ones. <br><br>
                For example, I now take my daily vitamins with my breakfast and I floss my teeth before brushing them. I also have replaced the desire to eat something sweet after every meal by drinking a tea or eating some fruits.  <br><br>
                From now on, I will first listen to myself and try to change my identity instead of focusing on the result I want to achieve.

                5. Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                The basic question that will be answered first is: <i> What are habits? </i><br>
                Habits are small, behaviors on a daily basis that we perform automatically without thinking about it. We are what we do every day. That means our habits shape our identity and vice versa. <br><br>
                Daily repetition has an enormous effect. James Clear is pointing that out by comparing habits with interest and its compound interest. After a certain time, one has achieved a remarkable result from tiny changes, as the title of the book says.
                <br><br>
                To understand the following step-by-step process of turning an action into a habit, you need to understand an essential property of habits: <br>
                Habits are self-reinforcing. That is, when you perform an action, the reward you receive will make you want to perform that action again. <br><br>
                With this knowledge, the 4 steps of a habit loop are easy to understand:  <br><br>
            </p> 
            <ol class="indent_list">
                <li>
                    A <b>cue</b> prompts your brain to act because it predicts a reward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After repeated action with accompanying reward, a <b>desire</b> will develop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The desire caused by the cue eventually leads to a <b>response</b>. It becomes a part of your identity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Last but not least, the execution of the action results in the <b>reward</b>. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                The more often you go through this feedback loop for a single habit, the more automated it becomes.
                <br>
                James Clear goes on to explain that there are 4 laws of behavior change that we can use to create good habits and break bad habits. For each law, he lists some methods that can help with implementation. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
                1. Law: Make it obvious
            </h3>
            <p>
                The habit must be easy to perform and can not require any effort. In other words, the cue that creates the desire and eventually leads to action must be obvious. <br>
                For example, if you want to read more, you should place a book in plain sight on the table so that your brain is directly exposed to the cue. <br>
                On the other hand, if you want to break a bad habit, you should try to minimize or even eliminate the cue.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
                2. Law: Make it attractive
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you want to perform a habit over and over again, make it attractive and keep it attractive. If an action is not attractive to us, we will probably not be able to muster enough willpower in the long run. <br>
                But if we make a habit attractive, it will be easier for us to perform it. For example, you can make going to the gym easier by listening to audio books.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
                3. Law: Make it easy
            </h3>
            <p>
                Try to keep the friction between you and the habit as low as possible. This way you increase the chances that you will perform the action/habit. 
                For example, you can pack your bag for the gym the night before or you plan and prepare a healty meal for the office/university/school.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
                4. Law: Make it satisfying
            </h3>
            <p>
                The problem with most habits is that they don't produce instant gratification. How many times have you given up on your diet or let your workouts slide because you didn't see progress? Yes, that's the problem... You could, for example, jump into the bathtub every time after the gym and really relax. Or if you want to quit smoking, you can put a certain amount of money into your vacation account for every week you stick it out.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Focus on systems
            </h2>
            <p>
                Another important topic are <i>systems</i>. James Clear appeals that we should forget about goals and focus on systems instead. <br> <br>
                Goals are results that we want to achieve. Systems, on the other hand, are processes that lead us to the results. <br>
                The example James Clear gives in his book is setting goals in sports. Winners and losers have the same goal - to win. But the winners become winners because they implement the right systems.
