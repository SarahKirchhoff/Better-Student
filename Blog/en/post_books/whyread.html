        <h2 class="sub_headline">You can only benefit from self-development literature</h2>
        <p class="absatz">
            You set your goals but you don't make any progess? Everyone around you is moving forward and you are still stuck? <br>
            Did you set the right goals? Do you experience a lack of motivation? Are you too shy or are you trying too hard? 
            Do you tend to reschedule your tasks and do you feel unproductive? How does your day looks like? Did you implement bad habits
            in your life?
        </p>
        <p class="absatz">
            My suggestion for you: Read self-development books!
        </p>
        <p class="absatz">
            My opinion of those books probalby used to be the same you are having right now. 
            "Why should I need something like that? Those books are stupid... full of 
            trivial ideas and approaches, that are well known or do not fit into MY life." 
            Let me tell you from personal experience, forget all you prejudices, open your
            mind and grab a book!
        </p>
        <p class="absatz">
            Here are my 6 reasons, why you should start reading books about self-development.
        </p>
        <h3>1. You will change your way of thinking</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Let's be honest. We are stucked in our beliefs and our way of thinking. We tend to
            hold on to what we know. Self-development literature will show you new ways of thinking about certain things and
            lets you see situations in your everyday life from a different point of view. <br>
            This counts for all areas of your life: job, relationship, health, finance and personal goals.
        </p>
        <h3>2. You will change your attitude</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            It's simple: If you change your way of thinking, you automatically will change your attitude.
            Tasks, which seem to be too hard and impossilbe to do, start seeming more realistic and less
            scary. Sure, they are not going to be easy, but your improved attitude is a good point
            to start. <br>
            Remember this: No one can achieve anything good with a poor attitude!
        </p>
        <h3>3. You learn to focus on what matters</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            This type of literature will teach you about how to structure your day in order to 
            get things done more effectivly. It will draw your attention to a system called prioritizing your
            tasks. Real soon you will realise that you may have spent too much time on tasks 
            that are not bringing you closer to your dream. Of course, we have to go to the supermarket
            and cook out meals, but you will learn to prioritize your other tasks. In 
            the end you will have more time to accomplish what brings you closer towards your goal.
        </p>
        <h3>4. You will get out of your comfort zone</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            After you have learned to set the right goals, you will realise that you have to get out of
            your comfort zone in order to achieve them. Literature about self-development helps exactly with this.
            It promotes creative thinking and encourages you to give 100% all the time.
        </p>
        <h3>5. You will be more aware of yourself</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Self-development is about developing and improving your mind. As soon as you mastered
            this, you are more aware of yourself. You start realising why you are doing certain things, as well 
            as you start realising that you may have implemented some bad habits, that you should try to get rid of 
            as soon as possible. <br>
            Besides that, you will stop thinking so much about what other people may think about you. You start realising
            that people, who talk behind your back, are just projecting their insecurities onto you. <br>
            You are more aware of everything around you, because you finally understand what's really going on.
        </p>
        <h3>6. The books are affortable</h3>
        <p class="absatz">
            Books for self-development are absolutly affortable. Between 10 and 15 Euros each. An amount even a students budget
            can affort. Just look at it from this perspective: How often are you buying a coffee or your favourite 
            pastry? So, there probalby is 10 Euros in your Budget for a book. <br>
            Please keep in mind: Investments in your development and knowledge are never a bad investment.    
        </p>
